CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Jurors in the University of Virginia defamation trial heard former Rolling Stone reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s extensive taped interviews of fake gang-rape victim “Jackie” on Friday — including an exchange in which “Jackie” displayed a tattoo she got to brand herself as a survivor.

“Did it ever occur to you that someone would get a tattoo on their body to commemorate a sexual assault that didn’t happen?” Rolling Stone defense lawyer Scott Sexton asked of the tattoo, described as a women’s symbol with a fist, a rose, and the word “unbreakable.”

Speaking in a wavering whisper, Erdely told a federal jury in Charlottesville, Virginia, “Never.”

Nicole Eramo, a former university associate dean, is suing Rolling Stone over what they’re calling Erdely’s malicious and careless reporting.

The 9,000-word, later-retracted feature article had claimed seven fraternity members raped “Jackie” at their frat house in September 2012, and that the associate dean callously turned a deaf ear.

The magazine’s defense lawyers are in turn trying to show that Erdely fell for the faux-assault story only after hours of compelling interviews.

On the tapes played Friday, “Jackie” describes in detail her “daddy issues,” her depression, her PTSD and the impact of the “assault.”

But jurors are already questioning whether it should have been obvious that “Jackie” was making things up.

At one point Friday, they handed a note to Judge Glen Conrad, asking what to make of Jackie’s many pronunciations of the fraternity’s name throughout the taped interviews.

“Jackie” seems to call it Chi Phi, Chi Psi, Pi Phi — rarely, if ever, the correct name.

Rolling Stone’s lawyer offered that he’d be happy to stipulate to “Phi Psi.”

But Libby Locke — lawyer for plaintiff Eramo — snapped to attention, asking that the jurors be instructed to trust their own ears because “it goes to credibility.”
